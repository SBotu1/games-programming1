game introduction

story intro level 1 setting intro first cave area 

option A B or C area of choice 

enemy 1 (area A) (harder than the second one will be based on name but the twist is the weaker one is actually strong visa versa) enemy 2 (area C) (potentially too strong option to escape and find correct weapon to fight it with) area C is a place with a chest but is a trap 

enemy and player health bar potentially if not kill instantly or fail and have the option to escape find a new weapon try your luck then die

enemy 1 area A is the only safe option as you defeat the enemy and progress through the cave then get swarmed by fire slimes use special ability out of three options or use sword

if sword is used you win but your sword gets destroyed by being burnt remove from list if water ability is used then you win instantly and keep the sword 

you then walk through and discover a treasure box but there is only 3 coins add three coins to invntory 

then finally you leave then next level 2 beigins the adventurer market where you need to buy items you have three options sword grappling hook or health potion add whatever is chosen the grappling hook is 1 coin same with the health potion and the sword is 2 

level 3
little bit of dialouge and story but then you head towards the legendary cave rumoured that you must be very strong to survive 

level three starts and you get enemy 2 from before as the first enemy you are stronger now so you win 

you get attacked by ice enemies

write function that makes a random backstory at the start of the game 
once both enemies are defeated escape the area
