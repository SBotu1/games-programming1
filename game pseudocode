game introduction

story intro level 1 setting intro first cave area 

option A B or C area of choice 

enemy 1 (area A) (harder than the second one will be based on name but the twist is the weaker one is actually strong visa versa) enemy 2 (area C) (potentially too strong option to escape and find correct weapon to fight it with) area C is a place with a chest but is a trap 

enemy and player health bar potentially if not kill instantly or fail and have the option to escape find a new weapon try your luck then die

enemy 1 area A is the only safe option as you defeat the enemy and progress through the cave then get swarmed by fire slimes use special ability out of three options or use sword

if sword is used you win but your sword gets destroyed by being burnt remove from list if water ability is used then you win instantly and keep the sword
